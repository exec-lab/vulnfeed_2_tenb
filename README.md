# VulnFeed 2 Tenb

VulnFeed 2 Tenb is a python script for parsing vulnerability data from Cyber Advisory Feeds into Tenable.sc.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip3 install feedparser pyTenable python-decouple requests
```

Setup your local .env file with the appropriate tenable.sc attributes (replace the attributes below with the ones specific to your environment).

```bash
SC_ADDRESS=10.0.0.102
SC_ACCESS_KEY=89b0aa234237ec13b06da8283919c0f7
SC_SECRET_KEY=8360bf971eb9a1e488d294d830a24eba
SC_PORT=8443
```
Download the vulnfeed_2_tenb.py script.

Notes:
* SC_ADDRESS can be an IP or hostname
* SC_PORT is optional
* The user who's API keys you select should be a part of the same primary group as your main users. No specific user role is needed for this user, as any user can create queries or view plugin data.
* T.sc 5.13 or higher is required [API key usage](https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/Content/GenerateAPIKey.htm)


## Usage

```bash
$ python3 vulnfeed_2_tsc.py -f us-cert # queries us-cert alerts and adds appropriate ones to T.sc

$ python3 vulnfeed_2_tsc.py -f ms-isac # queries ms-isac alerts and adds appropriate ones to T.sc
```

### Basic Workflow
1. Script is called and a feed is specified
2. RSS of the specified feed is pulled, and relevant CVE data is pulled from all recent entries
3. If no CVEs are discarded in the feed, the entry is discarded.
4. Tenable.sc is queried to see if detection exists for the CVEs listed in the entry, if no detection, the entry is discarded.
5. Tenable.sc is queried to see if a Query already exists, if so, the entry is skipped.
6. A Query is created with the feed title and CVEs as filters.

### Supported Feeds
* [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/advisory/?o=ms-isac&type=advisory) and [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/advisory/?o=ms-isac&type=advisory)
    * Note, this is the same feed; you can specify either for different labels in Tenable.sc
* [US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts)
* [ICS-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories)
* [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/)

### Suggested operations
* Run the script on a scheduled basis; daily is likely frequently enough. The script checks for and should not create duplicates.
* Run the script multiple times with different feeds specified to get multiple feeds into Tenable.sc.
